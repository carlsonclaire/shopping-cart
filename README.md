# SHOPPING CART PROJECT
A python application that a grocery store could use to create receipts for a selection of products.

## Prerequisites
To use this application, you will need:

  + Python 3.7+

This application does not require any third-party packages. (Unless you choose to import product data through CSV or other more involved means as described below).

## INSTALLATION
 Clone or download from github (https://github.com/carlsonclaire/shopping-cart). Product data for Claire's Grocery Store has been hard-coded into the shopping_cart.py file. To use this application in a different grocery store, you will need to update the product information. You can do this by updating the code in the shopping_cart.py file, or by using a more dynamic approach such as storing and accessing product information with a CSV file.

Once the product information is set, navigate to the project repository from the command line.

```sh
 cd shopping_cart
 ```

 ## USAGE
 Run the Python program:

 ```py
 python shopping_cart.py
 ```
