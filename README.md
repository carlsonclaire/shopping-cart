# SHOPPING CART PROJECT
A python application that a grocery store could use to create receipts for a selection of products.

## Prerequisites
To use this application, you will need:

  + Python 3.7+

This application does not require any third-party packages. (Unless you choose to import product data through CSV or other more involved means as described below)

## INSTALLATION
 Clone or download from github (https://github.com/carlsonclaire/shopping-cart). Product data for one grocery store has been hard-coded into the shopping_cart.py file. For use in a different grocery store, update this product information. A secondary (and more dynamic) approach to storing this product information would be with a CSV.

Once set, navigate to the project repository from the command line.

```sh
 cd shopping_cart
 ```

 ## USAGE
 Run the Python program:

 ```py
 python shopping_cart.py
 ```
